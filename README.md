### Frame Picker from Video File

A Tkinter GUI app from _**Bugra Otken**_

It's a basic app that lets you select:

1. a folder to store frames
2. interval per extraction (seconds)
3. a video file

and shows you the frames. You can check the
frames in a carousel view, and you can mark
any images to be deleted by the "_Delete
selected frames_" button. After pressing the
button, OS will delete the marked frames from
hard drive and app will be closed.

Recommended Python version is 3.11, all you
have to do is to install opencv-python package.
