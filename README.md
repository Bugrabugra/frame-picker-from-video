### Frame Picker from Video File

It's a basic app that lets you select:

1. a folder to store frames
2. interval per extraction (seconds)
3. a video file

and shows you the frames. You can check the
frames in a carousel view, and you can mark
any images to be deleted by the "_Delete
selected frames_" button. After pressing the
button, OS will delete the marked frames from
hard drive and app will be closed.
